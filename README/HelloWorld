1. Main method must be of public, if it is not no exception but JVM will tell
that "Main method not public"

2. main must have a signature of return type void and parameters as String array, if it is not then "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main" 

3. Java is case sensitive.

4. If we dont declare Class as public, by default it accepts as public.

5. Method if we declare return type, we should return else compiler(javac) will throw an error- missing return statement.

6. Parameters to main method i.e String [] args can be String [] a/b/any name.
It need not be named only args.
